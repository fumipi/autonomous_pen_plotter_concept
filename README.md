## Autonomous Pen Plotter Concept

This is a Webots simulation to show the concept of "Autonomous Pen Plotter", in which a robot draws the path of the uploaded svg file.

Demo

I am just getting started, and planning to make the robot "autonomous" with sensors, but currently using the "supervisor" controller to move the robot as a first step. And also, as webots.cloud does not support drawing by pen, I mimic the effect by making the robot's trail visible in the above demo.
